I'm a front-end developer from the Netherlands, but currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark. I love creating usable programs, websites, visualizations―and when I have some spare time―games. I'm always open for interesting projects and problems, so do not hesitate to contact me if you need a talented developer and designer. Have a look at my Curriculum Vitæ below or [download it as a PDF](cv-bram-stein.pdf). I love taking an idea and turning it into a product.
