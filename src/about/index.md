## About me

<figure>![](me.jpg)</figure>
I'm a Dutch developer and project manager with more than 10 years of experience in web development. I'm interested in web technology, typography, usability, visualizations, and mobile web development. I'm a product guy, so I like to own the whole process; from back of a napkin sketch to finished product. I'm always open for interesting projects and problems, so do not hesitate to contact me if you need a talented developer or manager. Or both.
