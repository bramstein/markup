## Treesaver: adaptive magazine layouts

Treesaver® is an in-browser reading experience that dynamically adapts to a user’s device and screen size. Using web-standard technologies present in HTML5, Treesaver enables innovative, visually appealing column-based page designs that don’t require any additional downloads: all you need is a modern web browser.

Most websites display the same design to all users, no matter what browser or device they are using. Because these designs don’t take into account the screen size, users on mobile devices must often resort to frequent zooming and scrolling in order to read content.
