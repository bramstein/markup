## Highres Quake Menu Textures

These are highres Quake1 menu textures for use with [modern Quake1 engines](http://wiki.quakesrc.org/index.php/Engines) such as [Darkplaces](http://www.icculus.org/twilight/darkplaces/) . The design goal for these textures was to make them as close to the original textures as possible, but with a higher resolution. The textures are made at 1024x768 resolution and mostly use vector graphics and blend modes so that they can be easily resized without (major) quality loss. I was originally planning to port my OpenGL Gui library to Quake, and needed some high resolution menu textures, hence these textures. However, due to a serious lack of time, these textures are all I have (at the moment). The download includes PNG files and the original Photoshop (PSD) files.
